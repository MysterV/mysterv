# Welcome to my profile...

## Key words about me
- perfectionist, overthinker and minimalist (is that combination even possible?)
- aspiring software developer
- messes around with software
- plays piano

My life motto:
> "It's simple[^1], unless *you* complicate it." ~ *me, 2024*


## Rambling about myself
My name is Myster (`/m…™st…ôr/`), aka `my5ter`, or `MysterV` (variations on the number `5`).  
Any correlation with real words such as `mister` or `mystery` is purely coincidental, when I came up with the name `Myster`, I thought it didn't mean anything.  

I'm a perfectionist, and often pay an unhealthy amount of attention to details.  

I love Python programming, and messing around with software in general.  
Everytime I come across a new app or website, I try to 'fix it up' with various code snippets, to remove unnecessary UI elements and add *minor* QoL improvements. If I can't find them online, I code them up myself.  

Everytime I come across a new video game, I try to go as far off the intended way to play it as possible, and invent my own route, if possible.  
Sometimes‚Ñ¢Ô∏è I share them on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@my5ter) (but most of it stays in my Videos folder, as I have no clue how nor the willpower to convert 100+ hours of game footage into bit-sized engaging content...)  

I love music, and playing piano (mostly game and movie soundtracks). Sometimes‚Ñ¢Ô∏è I share my playing on my [second YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MysterV).
