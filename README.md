## Rambling about myself
I'm Myster (`/m…™st…ôr/`), aka `my5ter`, or `MysterV` (variations on the number `5`).  

I love programming and messing around with software in general.  
Whenever I come across an app or website, I try to 'fix it up' with various code snippets to remove UI bloat and add *minor* QoL improvements. If I can't find them online, I code them up myself.  

Whenever I come across a video game, I go as far off the intended path as possible, mess around and invent my own route.
Sometimes‚Ñ¢Ô∏è I share my experience on my [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@my5ter) (tho keep most of it to myself, no willpower to go through hundreds of hours of footage)  

I love music and playing piano (mostly game and movie soundtracks). Sometimes‚Ñ¢Ô∏è I share my playing on my [second YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MysterV).

*don't trust the CSS supremacy, it's a lie (I dumped a bunch of CSS libraries into my web projects), Python is the real number one.

### Personal Software Picks (not sponsored)
Function
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md): offline-first, Markdown-based all-in-one: note-making, task, info & knowledge management, todo and shopping list, web browser-ish, database-ish app
- [TinyTask](https://tinytask.net/): very lightweight, yet powerful macro software, that pretty much records what you do, and then repeats it perfectly dot for dot
- [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys): a set of useful tools developed by Microsoft, that didn't make it into the official releases of Windows
- [WizFile](https://antibody-software.com/wizfile/): an extremely fast file finder that caches your entire hard drive and then can search any string in a path at lightning speed
- [Bulk Rename Utility](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Download.php): powerful file renaming tool that supports regex
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp): CLI app for downloading media from the internet (not just YouTube) (Spotify is not supported (ig for legal reasons))
- [EqualizerAPO](https://equalizerapo.com/): virtual audio equalizer/mixer with *sub-**1ms*** latency

QoL
- [AltSnap](https://github.com/RamonUnch/AltSnap): cool window management-ish app (it allows you to move any window around by clicking anywhere on it, not just the titlebar)
- [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/): very beautiful, and minimal web browser (the viewport can take up 100% of the window, doesn't even have a window border if you turn it off in settings)
- [WizTree](https://www.diskanalyzer.com/): creates a map of your hard drive's memory
