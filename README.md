# Welcome to my profile...

## Key words about me

- aspiring software developer
- messes around with software
- plays piano

My life motto:
> "It's simple[^1], unless *you* complicate it." ~ *me, 2024*


## Rambling about myself
My name is Myster (`/m…™st…ôr/`), aka `my5ter`, or `MysterV` (variations on the number `5`).  

I'm a perfectionist, and often pay an unhealthy amount of attention to details.  

I love Python programming, and messing around with software in general.  
Everytime I come across a new app or website, I try to 'fix it up' with various code snippets, to remove some UI elements and add *minor* QoL improvements. If I can't find them online, I code them up myself.  

Everytime I come across a new video game, I try to go as far off the intended way to play it as possible, and invent my own route, or at least mess around.  
Sometimes‚Ñ¢Ô∏è I share my experience on my [YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@my5ter) (but most of it stays in my `Videos` folder, as I have no willpower to go through 100+ hours of game footage to polish and release it...)  

I love music, and playing piano (mostly game and movie soundtracks). Sometimes‚Ñ¢Ô∏è I share my playing on my [second YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MysterV).

### Personal Software Picks (not sponsored)
Function
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md): offline-first, Markdown-based all-in-one: note-making, information & knowledge management, todo and shopping list, web browser-ish, database-ish app
- [TinyTask](https://tinytask.net/): very lightweight, yet powerful macro software, that pretty much records what you do, and then repeats it perfectly dot for dot
- [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys): a set of useful tools developed by Microsoft, that didn't make it into the official releases of Windows
- [WizFile](https://antibody-software.com/wizfile/): an extremely fast file finder that caches your entire hard drive and then can search any string in a path at lightning speed
- [Bulk Rename Utility](https://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Download.php): powerful file renaming tool that supports regex
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp): CLI app for downloading media from the internet (not just YouTube) (Spotify is not supported (ig for legal reasons))
